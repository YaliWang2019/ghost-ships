## ghost ships 

The [src](https://github.com/uaf372/ghost-ships/tree/main/game-logic/src) directory contains all classes necessary for game interactions. This includes methods for placing ships and tracking hits and misses by both human and computer players.

The [app](https://github.com/uaf372/ghost-ships/tree/main/game-logic/app) directory contains code used to demonstrate portions of gameplay during development; no complete end-to-end game demo is present.

The [tests](https://github.com/uaf372/ghost-ships/tree/main/game-logic/tests) directory contains unit tests of the class methods written using Catch2.

Both the app and tests directories contain supporting CMake and Visual Studio files.
