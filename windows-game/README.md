# ghost ships (windows)

A C++ console version of the game built for Windows. Slightly different visual presentation than portable version; gameplay remains the same.

The necessary game mechanics code from the [game-logic](https://github.com/uaf372/ghost-ships/tree/main/game-logic/src) directory is referenced in the visual studio project files.
